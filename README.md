# DailyDrip Elm Upgrade Progress

This repo exists to show the status of my progress upgrading [the Elm DailyDrip
Topic](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm) to support 0.18.  I'll try to keep
it up to date showing the progress.  If you find that it seems to have fallen
behind the truth of the situation, feel free to send me an email at
<josh@dailydrip.com>.
